    <p><a id="standard">The standard model is a quantum field theory. It classifies all elementary particles and describes three of the four fundamental forces; electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The one fundamental force missing is gravity.  The reasons for this can be quite complicated.</a></p>
    <p>Other fundamental particles are described using <a href="perturbation.html">perturbation</a> theory as the framework to describe its particle interactions. Gravity, on the other hand, is described using general relativity, basically stating that gravity is the curvature of spacetime. Gravitons are particles, quantums that are thought to be carriers of gravitational field. Although there have been stupendous efforts to describe gravity in its quantum levels, there have been no consistent theory that describes its behavior.  </p>
    <p>The standard model is created to be mathematically consistent. Whenever physicists tried to use math to include gravity into the standard models, infinite numbers would be produced. String theory was created to combat this problem.</p>
    <p>Normally particles are taken as dimensionless points that are defined by their mass, charge and spin. In string theory, these are taken as approximations.Instead of taking particles as points, we treat them as strings that are either open or closed. They vibrate in different modes, giving them their properties that define them. A particular quantum vibration mode of a closed string describes a graviton a particular quantum vibration mode of a open string describes a photon. </p>

    <h4><a id="move">We want to understand how these particles now move through our universe.</a></h4>
    <p>Particles propagate through our spacetime like waves. This makes us uncertain where they will land at a quantum scale when heading in the direction of an object. Thus, we can only calculate the probability of where they will land. When particles are ejected and their trajectories are calculated, myriads of factors need to be considered to determine their landing location. We have to sum all possible trajectories and all possible interactions they may have with other particles. As a particle is propagating through spacetime, it may absorb or emit photons along their path. We have to manually decide which interactions we are going to allow, and then include them into our calculations. </p>
    <p>When considering the way particles behave in string theory, interactions with other particles are already included and accounted for within the framework of this theory. When particles, which are represented as strings, are ejected and absorb or emit a photon, it will undergo a process where it will split and recombine with other particles. This does not need to be manually added into our calculations. It's all very complex math and requires mathematical techniques including quantum field theory. </p>

    <h4><a id="issues">Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this theory. The list goes:</a></h4>
    
    <p>1- There are two main types of particles in the real world; fermions and bosons. They are represented in the standard model. Fermions are described as matter particles while bosons are described as force-carrying or ‘interactions’ particles. The original theory developed in the 1960’s (known as bosonic string theory) only included bosons into the spectrum. Later on, a mathematical symmetry, called supersymmetry, was able to relate the fermion class to the boson class. The whole theory together then became known as Superstring theory. Another solution to incorporate fermions into string/superstring theory was to add spinors onto closed rings. Spinors, (not spinners!) are mathematical objects that represent fermionic degrees of freedom. They are treated as two-dimensional complex objects</p>
    <center><img src="standrad model.png" alt="standard mode"><h6>This the standard model</h6></center>
    <p>2- As mentioned above there are two main types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons, but during calculations, creating the framework of the standard model for string theory, physicists predicted a new class, named tachyons. Tachyons have an imaginary mass or root negative one. Critics have proposed that this is evidence of the model being unstable, while others have linked tachyons to unstable configurations or vacuum states. They can suggest a particular vacuum state is energetically unfavorable or that there may be a tendency for the system to evolve into a more stable state. Tachyons are also linked to the existence of higher dimensional objects.</p>
    <p>3- In our world, as we commonly think of it as, there should be four dimensions; length, width, height and time. String theory predicts 26 dimensions.  </p>
    <p>26 dimensions is not compatible with our four dimensional world. Luckily, when supersymmetry was introduced, the number of predicted dimensions changed to 10. One theory to explain this arrangement is that our three dimensions are just slices of a larger nine dimensional universe. This is known as the brane-bulk model. Our universe could be a four dimensional ‘brane’, an object extended into one or more spatial dimensions. It would then be embedded within a higher dimensional ‘bulk’ spacetime.</p>
    <p>Another theory, known as M-Theory suggests that there are 11 dimensions, 10 of them being compactified and one remaining large. </p>
    <p>The third theory consists of the four familiar spacetime dimensions and six compactified dimensions that are curled up and too small to observe. </p>
    <p>We can use analogy. An insect climbing a leaf can go up and down. From far away that's all you see, but if you go closer you may observe it can move left and right as well. In this framework, we imagine that we, the observers, are confined to a three dimensional ‘brane’, analogous to surveilling the insect moving up and down the leaf. We perceive our world as having three dimensions because we are limited to the brane. However, at a microscopic or fundamental level, the theory suggests that there could be additional dimensions, analogous to the insect’s ability to move in additional directions, left and right. Their compactification into small sizes allows the theory to be mathematically consistent and avoid conflicts with observed physics.</p>
    <h4><a id="other-phenomena">String theory seeks to explain multiple phenomenons, which we should also touch on. </a></h4>
    <p>There is an occurrence of particles moving surprisingly slow despite being assumed to be massless. It could be for the reason that the true nature of their paths remain intricate and hidden. Particles may be traveling a greater distance than we presumed, on a path unobservable to us in a compactified dimension.</p>
    <center><img src="curling.webp" alt="curling up of dimesnions"><h6>An artistic illustration for how dimensions can be  curled up</h6></center>
    <p>We can curl up dimensions in different ways. The specific geometry of these different dimension’s configurations and physical properties could potentially result in different universes with distinct laws of physics. We try to model a universe mathematically with particles in our standard model, but there isn't anything to say that there are other fundamental particles out there. Some theorists believe that our universe has changed over time, thus changing our laws of physics. This tries to absolve the shortcomings of the standard model for not being able to include gravity. </p>
    <h4><a id="learnt">What physcists intend to do with string theory</a></h4>
    <p>Despite being highly theoretical and remaining a subject of active research, string theory has provided significant advancements, such as in math. New mathematical techniques have been developed, including expanding understanding of geometry, topology and algebraic structures. It provided new insights into cosmology, with physicists trying to harness its potential to shed light on the early universe and its evolution, as well as phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy.  </p>
    <p>But that's just a theory; a physics theory. Thank you for reading. </p>
